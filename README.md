## FibonacciJS for JavaScript

Fibonacci sequence using JavaScript. This is the standard Fibonacci calculation with a twist, it includes the ability to furnish a ``filter`` of sorts for use throughout the sequence generation.

I should also add to expect the overall shape of the repository to change somewhat, especially as I figure out my tooling bits, establish the unit tests, and so forth.
